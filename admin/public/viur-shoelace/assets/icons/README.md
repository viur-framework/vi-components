# ViUR Icons Repository
We are trying to improve the user experience of all ViUR applications across diffrent plattforms and purposes. This icon repository is meant to help to deliver a similar look and feel for modules, buttons and more.

Please export your single-colored icons as SVG with presentation attributes attached. This way it is possible to overwrite colors with the help of CSS.

Recommendations:
- use only fill="#fff"
- use only opacity="25%", opacity="50%", opacity="75%", opacity="100%"
- use only square formats
